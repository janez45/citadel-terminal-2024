# Citadel Terminal Algorithm - 2024 Summer Invitational

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for our algorithm that was developed for the **2024 Citadel Summer Invitational**. Our team was one of 43 selected across the U.S. and Canada to compete in this prestigious programming competition.

We developed an end-to-end algorithm in Python for a competitive tower-defense game tournament. See https://terminal.c1games.com/rules for in-depth information about the game. 

Our algorithm focused on strategic pathfinding, attack optimization, and calculating our weak points to defend accordingly. We leveraged advanced techniques in discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and summation to maximize our team's scoring potential.

See `python-algo/algo_strategy.py` for all logic behind the algorithm.

### The final win rate obtained was 73%.
